		<p>Genetic Algorithm - A genetic algorithm is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection, commonly used to find solutions to optimization and search problems using mutation, crossover, and selection.</p>

		<p> For a genetic algorithm to be "alive" -
			<ol>
				<li>System must be able to directly replicate own instructions, and indirectly replicate machinery to execute them. (instructions for own replication)</li>
				<li>Replication must be fairly exact, but mutations should occur at a low rate.</li>

	<div class="snippet quaternary">
		<p>No mutation means no new genetic material, only recombinations of old. Too much mutation leads to chaos. "interesting systems balance on the edge of chaos."</p>
